# ✅ GitHub Actions Build Fix Applied

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: npm install timeout
**Problem:** The build was hanging during `npm install` and getting canceled.

**Solution:** Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle peer dependency conflicts.

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Issue #2: Missing timeout protection
**Problem:** Builds could hang indefinitely.

**Solution:** Added 30-minute timeout to prevent infinite hangs.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    timeout-minutes: 30
```

### Issue #3: Missing electron build scripts
**Problem:** Workflow was calling `electron:build:win`, `electron:build:mac`, `electron:build:linux` but these scripts didn't exist in package.json.

**Solution:** Added the missing scripts to package.json:

```json
"electron:build:win": "electron-builder --win",
"electron:build:mac": "electron-builder --mac",
"electron:build:linux": "electron-builder --linux"
```
