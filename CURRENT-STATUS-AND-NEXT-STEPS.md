# 🎯 Current Status & Next Steps

## 📍 Where We Are Now

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Web App Live**: http://93.127.214.171
2. **All 12 Tabs Functional**: Dashboard, AI tools, tracking, etc.
3. **Authentication**: Sign up/login working
4. **Database**: Real data with Supabase
5. **AI Integration**: Google Gemini chat working
6. **VPS Deployment**: Running 24/7 with PM2

### ⚠️ Current Issue:
You tried to build a Windows `.exe` on the Linux VPS and got:
```
⨯ wine is required
```

**Why?** Building Windows apps on Linux requires Wine (Windows emulator).

## 🎯 What You Need to Decide

### Choose ONE of these three options:

### Option A: GitHub Actions ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**What happens:**
- GitHub automatically builds Windows, Mac, AND Linux versions
- Takes 10-15 minutes (hands-off)
- No Wine installation needed
- Professional CI/CD setup

**To proceed:**
```bash
cd /var/www/goat-app
git add .github/workflows/build-desktop-apps.yml
git commit -m "Add automated desktop app builds"
git push origin main

# Then visit: https://github.com/DJSPEEDYGA/GOAT-Royalty-App2/actions
# Wait 10-15 minutes
# Download executables from Artifacts section
```

**You get:**
- ✅ Windows .exe (installer + portable)
- ✅ macOS .dmg
- ✅ Linux AppImage

---

### Option B: Install Wine on VPS

**What happens:**
- Install Wine on your VPS (takes 5-10 minutes)
- Build Windows .exe directly on VPS
- Total time: 15 minutes

**To proceed:**
```bash
# Install Wine
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wine64 wine32

# Build Windows app
cd /var/www/goat-app
npm run electron:build:win

# Your .exe will be in dist/ folder
ls -lh dist/*.exe
```

**You get:**
- ✅ Windows .exe only

---

### Option C: Build on Windows PC

**What happens:**
- Clone repository on Windows computer
- Build natively (fastest - 5 minutes)
- Test immediately

**To proceed:**
```bash
# On Windows PC:
git clone https://github.com/DJSPEEDYGA/GOAT-Royalty-App2.git
cd GOAT-Royalty-App2
npm install
npm run electron:build:win
```

**You get:**
- ✅ Windows .exe only
