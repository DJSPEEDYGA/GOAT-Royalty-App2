## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. npm Install Fix
```yaml
run: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
**Why:** Handles peer dependency conflicts that were causing timeouts

### 2. Timeout Protection
```yaml
timeout-minutes: 30
```
**Why:** Prevents builds from hanging indefinitely

### 3. Build Scripts Added
```json
"electron:build:win": "electron-builder --win",
"electron:build:mac": "electron-builder --mac",
"electron:build:linux": "electron-builder --linux"
```
**Why:** Workflow was calling these scripts but they didn't exist
