# üö® IMMEDIATE WINDOWS FIX GUIDE

## Your Current Issues:
1. ‚ùå Git identity not configured
2. ‚ùå ESLint version conflict (still showing 9.26.0)
3. ‚ùå Wrong directory path
4. ‚ùå Trying to run Hostinger deployment script on Windows (it's for Linux VPS only)

---

## üéØ STEP-BY-STEP FIX (Copy These Exactly)

### STEP 1: Configure Git (MUST DO FIRST)
Open Git Bash and run these two commands:

```bash
git config --global user.email "djspeedyga@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "DJ Speedy"
```

**Verify it worked:**
```bash
git config --global user.email
```
You should see: `djspeedyga@gmail.com`

---

### STEP 2: Navigate to Correct Directory
You're currently in: `~/Documents/goat-royalty-app`

Run this to see what's actually there:
```bash
pwd
ls -la
```

Then navigate to the correct location:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/goat-royalty-app
```

---

### STEP 3: Check Your Current Branch
```bash
git branch
```

If you're on `main`, switch to the feature branch:
```bash
git checkout feature/advanced-camera-sora2-integration
```

---

### STEP 4: Pull Latest Changes
```bash
git pull origin feature/advanced-camera-sora2-integration
```

---

### STEP 5: Clean Install (IMPORTANT)
```bash
# Remove old files
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Install with legacy peer deps flag
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will take 2-5 minutes. Wait for it to complete.

---

### STEP 6: Verify Installation
```bash
# Check if next is installed
ls node_modules/.bin/next
```

You should see: `node_modules/.bin/next`

---

### STEP 7: Start the Server

**Option A: Try Next.js (may fail)**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Option B: Use Express Server (will work)**
```bash
node server.js
```

Then open: http://localhost:3000

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Git Config Fails:
```bash
# Try without global flag
cd ~/Documents/goat-royalty-app
git config user.email "djspeedyga@gmail.com"
git config user.name "DJ Speedy"
```

### If npm install Still Fails:
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Try again
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### If You Can't Find the Directory:
```bash
# Search for it
cd ~
find . -name "goat-royalty-app" -type d 2>/dev/null
```

### If Express Server Won't Start:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
pwd

# Should show something like: /c/Users/COMPUTER 1/Documents/goat-royalty-app

# Check if server.js exists
ls -la server.js

# If it exists, run it
node server.js
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### About the Hostinger Deployment Script:
**DO NOT run the Hostinger deployment script on your Windows machine!**

That script is for deploying to a Linux VPS server, not for local Windows development.

To deploy to Hostinger:
1. First get the app working locally on Windows
2. Then SSH into your Hostinger VPS
3. Run the deployment script on the VPS (not on Windows)

---

## üìã COMPLETE COMMAND SEQUENCE

Here's everything in order (copy and paste one at a time):

```bash
# 1. Configure Git
git config --global user.email "djspeedyga@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "DJ Speedy"

# 2. Navigate to project
cd ~/Documents/goat-royalty-app

# 3. Check current branch
git branch

# 4. Switch to feature branch if needed
git checkout feature/advanced-camera-sora2-integration

# 5. Pull latest changes
git pull origin feature/advanced-camera-sora2-integration

# 6. Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 7. Start Express server (recommended)
node server.js
```

   - Output of `pwd` (current directory)
   - Output of `git branch` (current branch)
   - Output of `node --version` and `npm --version`
