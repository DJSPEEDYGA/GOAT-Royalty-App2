# 🤔 Which Build Method Should I Use?

## Quick Decision Tree

### ❓ Do you need the .exe file RIGHT NOW (in 15 minutes)?
**YES** → Install Wine on VPS and build locally
```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wine64 wine32
cd /var/www/goat-app
npm run electron:build:win
```

**NO** → Continue to next question

### ❓ Do you want Windows, Mac, AND Linux versions?
**YES** → Use GitHub Actions (builds all 3 automatically)
```bash
cd /var/www/goat-app
git add .github/workflows/build-desktop-apps.yml
git commit -m "Add automated builds"
git push origin main
# Then visit: https://github.com/DJSPEEDYGA/GOAT-Royalty-App2/actions
```

**NO** → Continue to next question

---

### ❓ Do you have a Windows computer available?
**YES** → Build natively on Windows (fastest and easiest)
```bash
# On Windows PC:
git clone https://github.com/DJSPEEDYGA/GOAT-Royalty-App2.git
cd GOAT-Royalty-App2
npm install
npm run electron:build:win
```

**NO** → Use GitHub Actions (recommended)
