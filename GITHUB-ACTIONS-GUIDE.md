# 🚀 GitHub Actions - Automatic .exe Building

## ✅ Setup Complete!

I've created a GitHub Action that will automatically build your standalone .exe file!

---

## 📋 How It Works

The GitHub Action will:
1. ✅ Run on Windows server (GitHub's)
2. ✅ Install all dependencies
3. ✅ Build Next.js
4. ✅ Create the .exe files
5. ✅ Upload them to GitHub Releases
6. ✅ Make them available for download

---

## 🎯 How to Trigger a Build

### Method 1: Create a Release Tag (Recommended)

```bash
# In your local repository
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

This will:
- Trigger the build automatically
- Create a GitHub Release
- Upload the .exe files
- Make them downloadable

### Method 2: Manual Trigger

1. Go to: https://github.com/DJSPEEDYGA/GOAT-Royalty-App2/actions
2. Click "Build and Release GOAT Royalty App"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Click the green "Run workflow" button
5. Wait 10-15 minutes
6. Download from the Artifacts section

---

## 📥 How to Download Your .exe

### After Creating a Tag:

1. Go to: https://github.com/DJSPEEDYGA/GOAT-Royalty-App2/releases
2. Find your release (e.g., v1.0.0)
3. Download the .exe files under "Assets"
4. Run the .exe!

### After Manual Trigger:

1. Go to: https://github.com/DJSPEEDYGA/GOAT-Royalty-App2/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts"
4. Download "GOAT-Royalty-App-Windows"
5. Extract and run the .exe!

## ⏱️ Build Time

- **First build**: 15-20 minutes
- **Subsequent builds**: 10-15 minutes

The build runs on GitHub's servers, so you don't need to do anything except wait!

1. **GOAT Royalty App Setup 1.0.0.exe** (~250 MB)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Version Numbering

Use semantic versioning:
- v1.0.0 - First release
- v1.0.1 - Bug fixes
- v1.1.0 - New features
- v2.0.0 - Major changes

### Tip 2: Pre-releases

Create a pre-release for testing:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0-beta
git push origin v1.0.0-beta
```

### Tip 3: Watch Build Progress

Go to Actions tab and watch the build in real-time!
