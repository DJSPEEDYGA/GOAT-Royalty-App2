- ✅ Local development server can run successfully
- ✅ All components and features are implemented
- ✅ GitHub repository is synchronized

### ❌ What's NOT Deployed
- ❌ No web server deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, etc.)
- ❌ No cloud hosting configuration
- ❌ No public URL for web access

---

## Application Architecture

### Type: Electron Desktop Application
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
- **Runtime:** Electron (Desktop wrapper)
- **Distribution:** `.dmg` (macOS) and `.exe` (Windows) installers

### Build Commands Available:
```bash
npm run dev              # Start development server (localhost:3000)
npm run build            # Build Next.js production bundle
npm run start            # Start Next.js production server
npm run electron         # Run Electron app
npm run start-electron   # Build and run Electron app

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Desktop Application (Recommended - Current Design)

**Pros:**
- Works offline
- Better performance
- Native OS integration
- Secure local data storage
- No server costs

**Steps to Build:**
```bash
cd GOAT-Royalty-App2

# For macOS
npm run electron-builder -- --mac

# For Windows
npm run electron-builder -- --win

# For Linux
npm run electron-builder -- --linux
```

**Distribution:**
- Upload installers to GitHub Releases
- Share download links with users
- Users install and run locally

---

### Option 2: Convert to Web Application (Requires Modifications)

**Pros:**
- Accessible from any browser
- No installation required
- Automatic updates
- Cross-platform by default

**Cons:**
- Requires significant code changes
- Needs server hosting costs
- Less secure for sensitive data
- Requires internet connection

**Required Changes:**
1. Remove Electron dependencies
2. Convert to pure Next.js app
3. Set up environment variables
4. Configure deployment platform
5. Set up database/storage
6. Implement web authentication

---

## Local Development Access

**Current Development Server:**
- URL: https://3000-7489b2c5-68a6-43b6-887c-d9ab89f22be7.proxy.daytona.works
- Status: Running (temporary development environment)
- Purpose: Testing and development only

**To Run Locally:**
```bash
cd GOAT-Royalty-App2
npm install
npm run dev
# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Recommendations

### For Production Use:

**1. Desktop Application (Current Architecture):**
   - Build installers for macOS and Windows
   - Create GitHub Release with download links
   - Distribute to users for local installation
   - Store API key in environment variables or secure config

**2. Web Application (Requires Conversion):**
   - Refactor to remove Electron
   - Deploy to Vercel/Netlify
   - Set up environment variables for API keys
   - Implement cloud database
   - Add web authentication

### For API Key Security:

**Desktop App:**
```javascript
// Store in .env.local (not committed to git)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=fF3mdJBw4IrG8f25sRiCeCWEQpwbArfXGQULv01K52f0b9b4
```

**Web App:**
```bash
# Set in deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify)
API_KEY=fF3mdJBw4IrG8f25sRiCeCWEQpwbArfXGQULv01K52f0b9b4
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Clarify Deployment Intent:**
   - Desktop app distribution? → Build installers
   - Web app deployment? → Begin conversion process

2. **API Key Configuration:**
   - Determine which services use this key
   - Set up secure storage method
   - Test API integrations

3. **Testing:**
   - Test all features locally
   - Verify API connections
   - Check data persistence

### Long-term Considerations:

- **Desktop App:** Set up auto-update mechanism
- **Web App:** Plan for scalability and hosting costs
- **Both:** Implement analytics and error tracking

---

## Conclusion

The GOAT Royalty App is **not deployed to a server** because it's designed as a **desktop application**. To make it accessible to users, you need to either:

1. **Build and distribute desktop installers** (recommended, matches current architecture)
2. **Convert to a web application** (requires significant refactoring)

The API key you provided should be configured in the application's environment variables for secure access to external services.
